# Titanic-Survival-Dashboard-Power-BI
In this Titanic survival analysis project, I developed a Power BI dashboard to gain insights into the passengers' survival patterns. The primary focus was on visualizing survival statistics based on different attributes.
**Dashboard Components:**  

**Survived Card:**  

•	A card was added to provide a quick glance at the total number of passengers who survived.  

**Bar Charts for Survived by Passenger Class and Sex:**  

•	Bar charts were designed to illustrate the distribution of survivors across passenger classes and sexes.
•	This allows viewers to easily compare and understand how survival rates vary based on these demographic factors.  

**Donut Chart for Age Groups of Survived People:**  

•	The donut chart was chosen to represent the age groups of the passengers who survived the Titanic disaster.
•	This visual helps in identifying which age groups had higher survival rates and contributes to the overall understanding of the demographics of survivors.  

**Slicer for Age Group and Sex:**  

•	To enhance interactivity, a slicer was added to filter data based on age groups and sex.
•	Users can dynamically explore the survival data by selecting specific age groups and genders, allowing for a more personalized analysis.  

**Insights and Interpretations:**  

•	**Survival by Class and Sex:**  

•	The bar charts highlight any patterns or discrepancies in survival rates based on passenger class and gender. For example, were there more female survivors in a particular class?  

•	**Age Group Distribution:**  

•	The donut chart provides an overview of the age distribution among survivors. It helps in understanding whether certain age groups had higher chances of survival.  

•	**Interactive Slicing:**  

•	The slicer feature allows users to drill down into specific subsets of data, making the analysis more dynamic. For instance, users can explore the survival rates of different age  
 groups within each gender.
